										<h3>Fellowships</h3>
										<h4>D. Allan Bromley </h4>
										<p> In 2019, I was awarded the D. Allan Bromley Graduate Fellowship.  This is awarded annually to support one or more students in Physics who have advanced to candidacy in the Ph.D. program, with attention to students who exhibit a broader interest 
										than just physics, including, but not limited to, science and public policy, engineering, and applied science. In this way, the recipients will reflect and celebrate Dr. Bromley’s distinguished and honorable persona in the exceptional scope, standing, 
										talent, and character of his distinguished personal, public, and academic life.
										</p>
										<h3>Awards</h3>
										<h4>The Leigh Page Prize</h4>
										<p>When I was accepted into Yale Physics in 2016, I was also awarded the Leigh Page Prize. The Leigh Page Prize is offered to incoming first year graduate students in recognition of their fine academic record and for the promise of important contributions to the field of physics. </p>
										<h4>Leigh Page Award for Excellence in Graduate Student Teaching</h4>
										<p>In the fall of 2021, I was one of the inaugural recipients of the Leigh Page Award for Excellenge in Graduate Student Teaching.  I have been a teaching fellow for 12 semesters, 8 more than is required for graduate students. 
										In the summer of 2020, I helped take the introductory physics labs virtual for the first time ever.  We worked to recreate the exploration learned when conducting experiments in students' own homes.  I also served as the Lead Teaching Fellow for 19 other TFs 
										in the fall of 2020 for the physics labs for non-majors courses.  I created introductory material for all TFs to use in their mini-lectures, advised others on how to run the virtual labs, and answered questions about grading.  I have also led exam review sessions
										and study halls for lecture physics courses and assisted in the Physics of Music Labs where students created their own musical instruments.  My full teaching history is included in my CV. </p>
										<p> The award seeks to acknowledge and celebrate excellence in graduate student teaching, distinct among the already high standard of teaching that graduate students in the physics department consistently achieve. This award will support the graduate program learning goal that “Students will become educators and communicators with the ability
										to promote an understanding and appreciation of physics across the university and in society” and help solidify in our community that effective and informed teaching is one of our core values.  Excellence in teaching is based on the following criteria, where applicable: 
											<ul>
											<li>Establishing an inclusive classroom environment, providing support and flexibility so that all students can thrive.</li>
											<li>Inspiring students to develop the habits and skills of independent thinking and scientific inquiry and engagement.</li>
											<li>Enthusiasm for the craft and practice of teaching, with a focus on continuous development and consistent improvement. </li>
											<li>Demonstrated leadership/mentorship of peer educators and encouragement of effective teaching in others. </li>
										     </ul>
