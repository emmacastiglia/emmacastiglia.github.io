									<p>I am a Research Data Scientist at Meta working in the privacy program.  I am applyiing and evaluating ML models to

										I received my PhD  in physics from Yale where my research focused on applying machine learning to improve detector 
									  performance and optimize signal sensitivity at the ATLAS experiment.
									  I recieved my BA in both physics and mathematics from the University of Chicago.  
									To improve my ML knowledge before moving to industry, I took Deep Learning courses at Yale, attended ML focused summer schools, 
									and completed an ML research internship. </p>

									<p> Outside of physics and ML, I am deeply committed to improving gender equity

										the IDS Allyship circle.  I served as the chair (co-chair) for 3 years 
									for both Women in Physics+ and Equity in the Job Search Symposium at Yale and have advocated
									for diversity and inclusion initiatives within my department.  I really enjoy teaching and inspiring younger students and
									taught for 12 semesters at Yale and been a part of 3 women in STEM mentoring programs.  </p>

						</header>
						<p>For the past 8 years I have researched for the ATLAS collaboration at CERN.  I am currently working on a search for a rare Higgs boson decay to tau leptons.  I trained a neural network
							to separate out the main background that most closely resembled our signal.  The neural network score is the final discriminating variable in our fit model.
						I worked on ML improvements for the Tau Trigger by optimizing a BRT to improve energy calibration and explored using an equivariant neural network in the Tau ID.  
							I spent a year working on a Higgs boson to ZZ_dark search using a BDT, which combined the buzz wordy topics of ML, Higgs boson, and dark matter!</p>

						<p>During my second year at Yale, I conducted research for Mu2e which is a planned Intensity Frontier Experiment at Fermilab.  It is trying to detect
						the charged lepton flavor violating decay (which would be a beyond the Standard Model process) of a muon decaying directly to an electron.
						I worked on calorimeter triggers for both signal electrons and high energy photons and benchmarked other MVA algorithms in the trigger system.</p>

						I explored many of Yale's course offerings and took classes in Deep Learning, where I trained a CNN to classify famous painting.  I also served as a Teaching Fellow for 12 semesters in courses

						<p>I attended the University of Chicago, where I double majored in physics and math, studied abroad in Paris (with the Paris Math Program), and
						filled my free elective spaces with art classes.  I spent my junior and senior years, plus the summers before, researching for the ATLAS experiment 
						under Professor <a href="https://hep.uchicago.edu/~ykkim/index.shtml">Young-Kee Kim</a>.  This is where I learned how to code and got my start in particle physics research working on a Higgs boson coupling dark matter
