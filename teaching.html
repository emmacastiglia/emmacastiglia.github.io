											<h3>Yale Daily News Article about Virtual Labs </h3>
                      <p>The Yale Daily News posted an article about taking the labs fully virtual in the Fall of 2020.  Over the summer we taught using videos and students 
                      conducted experiments with house hold items.  In the Fall, every student was sent a kit that was utilized in labs towards the end of the semester and the final exam. </p>

										<h3>Selected Courses</h3>
										<h4>General Physics Laboratory </h4>
										<p> I have taught the laboratory sequence several times.  As a TF, I give an introductory mini lecture about the physics covered in the lab, and then lead 12-16 students, working in pairs,
                      through the experiment.  I then graded weekly lab reports and midterm/final exams.  Inspired by one of my former TFs, I made chocolate chip cookies for their finals. I was one of the TFs when the lab was taken fully virtual in the summer of 2020.  I helped create the exploratory
                      assignments, being mindful of students situations.  Students could choose from creating a mini experiment with supplies at home or watching videos of the professor conducting experiments and pointing 
                      out errors ("What's the Flaw?").  In Fall of 2020, I was lead TF for 19 teaching fellows, many first time TFs!  I shared my introductory slides and gave advice about running the lab.  As I taught the first 
                      section, I pointed out areas where students got confused to make sure other TFs were prepared to jump in when that point was reached.  For this semester, we shipped kits to all the students
                      so that they had the proper supplies to conduct their own experiments outside of the usual lab setting.

                    <h4>  Fundamentals of Physics </h4>
										<p> In 2019, I was awarded the D. Allan Bromley Graduate Fellowship.  This is awarded annually to support one or more students in Physics who have advanced to candidacy in the Ph.D. program, with attention to students who exhibit a broader interest 
										than just physics, including, but not limited to, science and public policy, engineering, and applied science. In this way, the recipients will reflect and celebrate Dr. Bromley’s distinguished and honorable persona in the exceptional scope, standing, 
										talent, and character of his distinguished personal, public, and academic life.
