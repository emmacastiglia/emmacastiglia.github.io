											<h3>Yale Daily News Article about Virtual Labs </h3>
                      <p>The Yale Daily News posted an article about taking the labs fully virtual in the Fall of 2020.  Over the summer we taught using videos and students 
                      conducted experiments with house hold items.  In the Fall, every student was sent a kit that was utilized in labs towards the end of the semester and the final exam. </p>

										<h3>Selected Courses</h3>
										<h4>General Physics Laboratory </h4>
										<p> I have taught the laboratory sequence several times.  As a TF, I give an introductory mini lecture about the physics covered in the lab, and then lead 12-16 students, working in pairs,
                      through the experiment.  I then graded weekly lab reports and midterm/final exams.  Inspired by one of my former TFs, I made chocolate chip cookies for their finals. I was one of the TFs when the lab was taken fully virtual in the summer of 2020.  I helped create the exploratory
                      assignments, being mindful of students situations.  Students could choose from creating a mini experiment with supplies at home or watching videos of the professor conducting experiments and pointing 
                      out errors ("What's the Flaw?").  In Fall of 2020, I was lead TF for 19 teaching fellows, many first time TFs!  I shared my introductory slides and gave advice about running the lab.  As I taught the first 
                      section, I pointed out areas where students got confused to make sure other TFs were prepared to jump in when that point was reached.  For this semester, we shipped kits to all the students
                      so that they had the proper supplies to conduct their own experiments outside of the usual lab setting.  This course is geared towards non-physics majors.  Teaching it imrpoved my ability to expain complicated physics topics in an easily digestible way.
										</p>
                    <h4>  Fundamentals of Physics </h4>
										<p> I have taught the Fundamentals of Physics sequence twice.  This is the first class that many physics and engineering majors take.  I was in charge of a weekly study hall, where I assisted groups of students
											to solve the problem sets together.  I also ran one-on-one office hours for more focused teaching.  I also wrote up solution sets, proctored and graded exams, and led exam review sessions for the class.
										</p>
                    <h4> Modern Physical Measurement </h4>
										<p> This is the second laboratory that physics majors take.  It is a bit of an art to teach, as each pair of students is doing a different lab at the same time.  These labs include the Millikan Oil Drop, x-ray diffraction, and measuring fundamental constants.
											Besides assisting students with the labs, I graded their lap reports where I gave detailed feedback on how best to explain their method and results.
										</p>
                    <h4>Physics of Music and Instrument Design </h4>
										<p> For a departure from a standard physics course, I was a TF for the physics of music class.  I mainly graded problem sets and assisted in labs.  The labs were held in the Center for Engineering Innovation and Design 
											and students created their own musical instruments, such as recorders and stringed instruments.  We also went on tours of Yale's organ in Woolsey hall and carillon in Harkness tower.
